Multiplications info: We represent the multiplications on a circle where n points are placed at equal distance (10 in base 10). A line is drawn between the number and the result of the multiplication by the chosen multiple. Example, 6 x 2 = 12 so we draw a line between 6 and 2 (12-10).

Pentagon info: A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The ratio between a diagonal and a side is equal to the golden ratio. This is not true for other regular polygons.

Perlin noise: Perlin noise
Perspective: Perspective
Pi Monte-Carlo info: The Monte-Carlo method consists of randomly choosing a point inside a square. The probability p that the point is in the circle inscribed in the square tends towards Pi/4 (thus Pi = p x 4).
Pi Odds inverses info: The alternating sum (+/-) of the inverses of the odd tends towards π/4 (so π = sum x 4).
Pi polygons info: We draw a regular polygon inscribed in a circle. π is equal to perimeter of the polygon / (2 x radius of the circle). The polygon ends up merging with the circle whose perimeter is equal to 2π x radius of the circle.
Pi Prime Numbers info 2: To test this method, we choose two numbers at random and determine if they are coprime (mark a success in this case). The operation is repeated n times, recalculating the probability each time (number of successes/number of draws). 3.14... after +1000 iterations
Pi Prime Numbers info: The method of prime numbers tells us that the probability that two numbers are prime numbers is equal to 6/π^2
Pi Square inverses info: The sum of the inverses of the squares of the integers converges to π^2/6 (so π = √6).

Triangle probabilities info: For each line of level n, we calculate the relative probability of having 0 to n times "tails" for n consecutive flips of a coin. For 4 throws, there are thus 6 times more chances of obtaining 2 "tails" than of having 0 or 4 "tails".
